# Challenge4

This web application is a quiz designed to test the knowledge of the inventory counters within a given business. 

The purpose of testing the readiness of the counter to perform vital functions within the department is to ensure that quality is always upheld as the basic tenant of prodcution.

Future development will be to add user input answers to test memory of counters.

Lessons learned:
1. Local storage for the score was more easily set by including the calculation of original score vs. creating a variable that grabs the end result score and calling on that variable.

2. Pseudocoding out the framework and functionality of the code streamlined the developing process by narrowing the scope of what functions performed to achieve the Minimal Viable Product.
